While I was working at the Ultra-Fast Nano Optics group at UC Berkeley, I developed a python script that leveraged the computer vision library OpenCV in order to detect graphene flakes from images we took under microscope. My script had to pre-process the image to clean the data for better analysis, it then had to be able to identify desirable graphene flakes from undesirable ones and surrounding noise. The whole project taught me a lot about clustering algorithms, signal processing, image processing, and other forms of data analysis.
