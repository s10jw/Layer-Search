Throughout we use the term 'global flake' or 'global contour' to represent one graphene flake. Each global
flake or contour may be composed of regions of varying thicknesses, throughout this program, these regions are referred 
to as 'local flakes' or 'local contours'. A 'Global mask' refers to a 'global flake' that has had a mask applied to it, 
while a 'local mask' refers to a 'local flake' that has had a mask applied to it.
